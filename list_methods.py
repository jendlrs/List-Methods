#Seatwork in DSA

#Write a python program that do the following:

#- display the initial content of the array
#- display a menu of options
#- allow user to select item in the menu (check if valid)
#- perform the selected option (you may prompt additional info to user when need)
#- display the resulting values of the array

#Note: 
#- The program has an array variable containing 10 random numbers
#- You may add other options and features
#- Your program should be uploaded to github before 1:30pm
#- Record a demo presenting your program
#- Send the demo directly to my messenger

#Example Output:

#Array: [1, 4, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6 ,2 ,56, 200]
#Menu:
# 1 -> Add an element
# 2 -> Insert an element
# 3 -> Modify an element
# 4 -> Delete an element
# 5 -> Arrange in ascending order
# 6 -> Arrange in descending order
#What do you want to do? (1-6): 4
#Enter the index you want to delete: 3
#The element has been deleted
#This is the new array: Array: [1, 4, 3, 4, 5, 6 ,2 ,56, 200]

#1st step: Create and display an array
array = [4, 12, 16, 1, 9, 10, 23, 30, 51, 6]
print (array)
#2nd step: Display the options for the user
#3rd step: Create the conditions for each option
#4th step: Display the new Array
